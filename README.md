# Server Driven UI Experiment with Flutter and Mirai

Welcome to the Server Driven UI experiment using Flutter and the Mirai package. This project explores the implementation of a server-driven UI approach, leveraging Flutter's flexibility and Mirai's capabilities.

## Overview

This project is an experimental Flutter application that demonstrates the use of server-driven UI principles. The app fetches UI configurations from a server and dynamically builds the user interface based on the received data. We utilize the Mirai package to parse and render the UI components.

## Features

- **Dynamic UI Rendering**: Build user interfaces on the fly based on server responses.
- **Modular Components**: Easily extendable components for various UI elements.
- **Live UI Updates**: Reflect changes in UI without the need for app updates.
- **Flutter 3.19.4**: Built using Flutter version 3.19.4 for the latest features and improvements.
